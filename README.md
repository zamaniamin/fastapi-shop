## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/zamaniamin/fastapi-shop.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```shell
    cd fastapi-shop
    ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```shell
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install project dependencies:**

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

To configure your FastAPI Shop project, create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.template` file and filling in the
actual values. Here's an example:

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`.
2. Open `.env` in a text editor.
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details.
4. Save the file.

### Usage

1. **Start the FastAPI server:**

    ```shell
    uvicorn apps.main:app --reload
    ```

2. **Access the API documentation at** `http://localhost:8000/docs` **to explore and interact with the API endpoints
   using the Swagger UI.**

3. **Add Demo Data:**

    - **Step 1 (Optional):** You can skip this step if you don't want to add your own demo images. The project includes
      existing demo images located at `apps/demo/media/products/{product_id}`.

    - **Step 2:** To prevent conflicts during development, remove your database tables. For development, I recommend
      using SQLite.

    - **Step 3:** Run the following command to create demo data, including fake products with images, a fake admin, and
      a fake user:

    ```bash
    python demo.py
    ```

   This will populate your database with a variety of demo data for testing and development purposes.

   Now after running the demo script, you can login as a "`superuser`" with the following credentials:
   ```bash
   username: superuser@example.com
   password: Demo_1234
   ```
   or you can login as a "`member`" with these credentials:
   ```bash
   username: member@example.com
   password: Demo_1234
   ```

## Customization

FastAPI Shop is designed to be highly customizable to suit your eCommerce needs. You can extend and modify the project
by:

- Adding new API endpoints to handle additional features.
- Customizing the database models in `models.py` to reflect your product catalog, user profiles, and more.
- Enhancing the user interface by integrating a front-end framework of your choice.

## Deployment

For deployment, consider using popular cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku. Ensure you set up proper
security measures and scalability options.
